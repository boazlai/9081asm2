# Haunted Orders: Ghosts, Mahjong & Midnight Deliveries

**A 90-Minute Urban Legend Walking + MTR Tour of Yau Ma Tei & Hung Hom**  
_Designed for international HKU students who want real Hong Kong ghost stories, dark history, and a proper thrill — no tourist traps, no fake jump-scares, just pure local chills_

## 1. Title & Tour Concept

### Tour Concept (200 words)

Most Hong Kong ghost stories feel random, but in Yau Ma Tei and Hung Hom there is a strange pattern: the dead keep trying to join the living’s favourite activities — playing mahjong and ordering late-night food deliveries. This tour follows that eerie thread across five haunting sites, connecting the 1996 Garley Building fire, 1950s mahjong-parlour ghosts, and the 1944 Allied bombing that killed 200 schoolchildren. Participants will stand where delivery boys received joss paper instead of cash, where headless mahjong players were seen through windows, and where temple caretakers still call the child ghosts home every night. By blending archival facts, multiple versions of the legends, and on-site observation, the tour reveals how Hong Kong uses humour, food, and games to process unthinkable tragedy. The experience turns fear into empathy and shows how urban legends keep the forgotten dead “alive” in collective memory. Perfect for international students who want to feel the real pulse (and chills) of Hong Kong culture.

### What Makes This Tour Unique

This is the only tour that connects the “ghost food-delivery” and “mahjong ghost” motifs across decades and districts. Instead of generic haunted-house stories, you get five sites where the dead literally try to keep living Hong Kong daily life — ordering porridge, collecting mahjong winnings, calling the police for help. The emotional arc moves from modern tragedy (Garley fire) to 1950s mystery to the heartbreaking WWII school bombing, ending with a surprisingly tender ritual that still happens every night.

## 3. Checkpoint 1 · JD Mall (former Garley Building site)

**233 Nathan Road, Jordan (starting point)**

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – JD Mall / Garley Building site]`

**Background Fact**  
On 20 November 1996, welding sparks ignited wooden scaffolding inside the renovating Garley Building. The open elevator shaft acted like a chimney, sending fire and smoke racing upwards. 41 people died, many trapped on the upper floors. The building was demolished in 2003; JD Mall now stands in its place.

**Urban Legends**

1. Priscilla Chan entered the lift to Polygram Records (10/F) but it shot straight to a pitch-black 15/F that shouldn’t exist. Some say she briefly time-traveled to the burned-out future.
2. After the fire, Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station received repeated emergency calls from cancelled 15/F phone numbers: “There’s a huge fire, come save me!”
3. Nearby restaurants kept receiving delivery orders from sealed-off floors. When the boy arrived, only a hand came out to pay… in joss paper.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
The “ghost delivery” motif is now everywhere on Hong Kong social media (Foodpanda, Deliveroo jokes). The dead are imagined as still hungry, still participating in 21st-century life — a very Hong Kong way of refusing to let victims be forgotten.

## 4. Checkpoint 2 · Site of 452 Nathan Road

_(now a modern building opposite Tin Hau Temple)_

**Walk 9 minutes north along Nathan Road**

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – 452 Nathan Road / tong lau location]`

**Background Fact**  
In the 1950s–70s this was a typical tong lau with mahjong parlour building. On the night of 4 March 1953 thousands gathered to watch the “haunted flat”.

**Urban Legends (the famous mahjong ghost cluster)**

- Ghost hand reached from under the table to collect winnings; another ghost hand shuffled tiles.
- Headless figures seen playing mahjong through the window (later versions say they were WWII air-raid victims still playing when the bomb hit).
- Every night at 9 pm a porridge shop received phone orders for four bowls to the 4th floor. The hand paid in real money… that turned into joss paper on the way back. When the furious delivery boy kicked the door down — four headless ghosts playing mahjong.

(There are at least five major variants of this story across Yau Ma Tei, Hung Hom and even Tai Po — showing how one template travels.)

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Mahjong is social glue in Hong Kong. By imagining the dead still playing, the city keeps victims inside the community rather than isolated in death. The joss-paper punchline is dark humour — classic Hong Kong coping mechanism.

## 5. Checkpoint 3 · Yau Ma Tei MTR Station – Platform 1

_(Tsuen Wan Line towards Central)_

**3-minute walk from Checkpoint 2**

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Yau Ma Tei MTR platform]`

**Background Fact**  
Station opened 1979, no platform screen doors until much later.

**Urban Legend**  
10 Nov 1981, 1:50 pm: train driver and passengers saw a teenage girl jump. Emergency brake applied. Screams everywhere. After full search — no body, no blood. Some versions say a female student saw her doppelgänger jump and died of fright days later. 2019 update: the girl allegedly survived by lying between the rails, later became Christian.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Classic “almost-died” survivor tale that keeps getting retold whenever MTR suicides spike. Shows how the city turns trauma into moral lesson or miracle story.

**Transit Note**  
**(Take MTR from Yau Ma Tei → Whampoa, 9 minutes, Exit C2)**

## 6. Checkpoint 4 · Kwun Yum Temple & Hung Hom Kaifong Association Primary School Site

**12-minute walk from Whampoa MTR Exit C2, via Tak Man Street**

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Kwun Yum Temple exterior / courtyard]`

**Background Fact**  
16 October 1944 — Allied forces bombed Whampoa Dock but hit the neighbouring school instead. The building collapsed, killing ≈200 students and teachers in minutes. Only those who hid in Kwun Yum Temple survived.

**Urban Legends**

1. The temple remained completely undamaged — a miracle of Kwun Yum (Goddess of Mercy).
2. Every night when the caretaker locks up, he calls out: “It’s dark! Temple closing! Children, come back!” so the young ghosts know to return to the temple instead of wandering.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
The tender nightly roll-call is one of Hong Kong’s most heartbreaking rituals. It transforms terror into care — the living still acting as parents/teachers to the dead children 81 years later.

## 7. Checkpoint 5 · Fok Tak Temple (Fuk Tak Temple), Dock Street

**3-minute walk from Kwun Yum Temple**

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Fok Tak Temple wall / altar]`

**Background Fact**  
Some of the school victims’ remains were unidentifiable; ashes were mixed and interred in the temple walls.

**Urban Legend**  
That’s why the temple walls are unusually thick — they contain the ashes of the bombed children.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
The wall literally carries the children, refusing to let urban redevelopment erase them. A quiet act of resistance and love.

**Tour ends here** — you can take MTR Hung Hom Station (8 min walk) or bus back, or stay for the brave, have late-night congee nearby and see if anyone orders four bowls and pays in joss paper…

See you on the other side. 👻
