## 3. Checkpoint 1 · Tin Hau Temple (Yau Ma Tei)

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Tin Hau Temple courtyard]`

**Background Fact**  
Yau Ma Tei Tin Hau Temple is regarded as the birthplace of urban Kowloon. Built in 1870 on the original shoreline to protect Tanka fishermen who worshipped the Sea Goddess Tin Hau, it lost its seaside location after repeated land reclamations. The open square in front, shaded by a large banyan tree known as "Banyan Tree Head", became a popular gathering spot for residents, street performers and vendors, evolving into the famous Temple Street Night Market. Despite its vibrant atmosphere, the area has long been associated with triads, prostitution, gambling and drugs. Remarkably, urban legends about the temple worshipping both ghosts and gods remain rare.

**Chinese Mythology**  
Tin Hau, also known as Mazu ("Maternal Ancestor"), was a real woman named Lam Muk born in 960 AD on Meizhou Island, China. Silent at birth, she grew into a gifted shamaness whose accurate weather predictions protected local fishermen. She died at 27, but legends of her posthumous miracles spread rapidly. Worshipped as the Goddess of the Sea, she became vital to coastal communities. A famous tale tells of her astral projection during weaving: she fought a sea monster, saved four storm-tossed ships, but lost one when her mother's touch snapped her back to her body. Later titled "Tin Hau" (Heavenly Empress), hundreds of seaside temples in Hong Kong and beyond honour her enduring protection of seafarers.<sup class="sup-ref">1</sup>

**Common Ritual**  
Before sailing, Zhoushan fishermen performed the Tin Hau candle ritual: lighting three incense sticks or candles at her temple. If wind extinguished them once or thrice, it signalled dangerous conditions and an unfavourable voyage; only steady flames granted divine permission to set sail safely.<sup class="sup-ref">1</sup>

## 4. Checkpoint 2 · Yau Ma Tei Carpark Building

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Yau Ma Tei Carpark exterior]`

**Background Fact**  
The Yau Ma Tei Carpark Building, completed in 1957 (with the Gascoigne Road flyover added in 1970), is notorious as "the deathliest place in Yau Ma Tei" due to suicides by jumping and drug overdoses in its Temple Street-facing toilets. Sparse urban legends include drivers trapped in time-warps or lost for hours inside. Ironically, its ground-floor public library was once a beloved air-conditioned oasis for locals.

**Urban Legends**  
The Yau Ma Tei Car Park is linked to two urban legends: One is a driver come across a time-warp while driving through the Gascoigne Road flyover; Another legend is a person stuck in the building for two hours can't figure the way out.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
These urban legends likely derived from the car park's unique design: the Gascoigne Road flyover pierces straight through the building, and its dimly lit tunnel resembles an eerie "time tunnel," sparking tales of time-warps and time-travel. Additionally, the near-identical layout of each floor creates a disorienting maze, setting the base for stories of people lost for hours while trying to leave.

## 5. Checkpoint 3 · 452 Nathan Road

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – 452 Nathan Road building]`

**Background Fact**  
The old building was located on the opposite to the Tin Hau Temple, but it was demolished and rebuilt into a new building in 1977.

**Urban Legends**  
Hong Kong's famous "Headless Mahjong Ghosts" legend cluster centres on 4th-floor flats in old tenement buildings (Yau Ma Tei, Hung Hom, Tai Po). Recurring motifs:

1. Four players (often headless, killed mid-game by WWII air raids) continue gambling as ghosts.
2. Invisible or ghostly hands shuffle tiles and collect winnings; neighbours see headless figures or hear endless mahjong clatter.
3. Every night they phone nearby porridge shops for exactly four bowls. A disembodied hand pays with real money that turns into joss paper.
4. When delivery boys or police finally force entry, they discover either four headless ghosts still playing or four decomposing bodies with the restaurant's food in their stomachs.
5. In some versions, those who burst in die of fright that same night.

One early variant involves only ghostly hands interfering in a living mahjong game, possibly a hoax by property rivals. The stories were widely shared from the 1980s–2000s, is one of Hong Kong's classic gambling-ghost stories.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
These legends are deeply rooted in Hong Kong's traditional mahjong culture, reflecting the game's central role in past social life and the superstitions that surrounded it. The detail of Ye's daughter acting as live-in caretaker of the vacant flat also mirrors a once-common local practice, where overseas Chinese owners entrusted relatives to occupy and watch over their properties.

## 6. Checkpoint 4 · Yau Ma Tei MTR Station – Platform 1

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Yau Ma Tei MTR platform]`

**Background Fact**  
Yau Ma Tei finally opened on 22 December 1979 as an infill station on the Kwun Tong Line (extended from Shek Kip Mei to Tsim Sha Tsui), initially operating only the upper platform. The lower platform began service on 26 April 1982 when the Modified Initial System was split into the distinct Kwun Tong and Tsuen Wan lines. In 2016, the Kwun Tong Line was further extended to Whampoa.<sup class="sup-ref">2</sup>

**Urban Legend**  
On 10 November 1981, at around 1:50 pm, a Tsuen Wan-bound train was pulling into Yau Ma Tei station when the driver and passengers on the platform suddenly saw a teenage girl in school uniform leap onto the tracks. Screams rang out as the driver slammed on the emergency brakes. The train screeched to a halt, yet when staff searched beneath the carriages—no body, no blood, nothing.

Over the years the story mutated: some say a female student on the platform saw her "another self" jump in front of the train, then fled home in terror and died days later. Another girl who claimed to be the friend of the girl who jumped into the rail, crouched between the rails, survived unharmed, escaped the station, later converted to Christianity, and is still alive today.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Yau Ma Tei station as one of the busiest transfer stations in Hong Kong, its urban legend reflects collective anxieties about youth pressures in Hong Kong's competitive society. The ghostly jumper symbolizes the tragic consequences of academic stress and societal expectations on teenagers. The story serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the need for mental health awareness and support for young people facing overwhelming challenges.

## 7. Checkpoint 5 · JD Mall (former Garley Building site)

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – JD Mall / Garley Building site]`

**Background Fact**  
The Garley Building in Yau Ma Tei, at the corner of Nathan Road and Waterloo Road, was the site of Hong Kong’s deadliest commercial fire. On 20 November 1996, welding sparks during elevator renovation ignited wooden boards, and the open shaft created a deadly “chimney effect.” Thick smoke and flames rapidly engulfed the upper floors, trapping dozens in offices. Forty-one people died and over 80 were injured; many victims were seen waving desperately from windows before perishing. Despite limited structural damage, the building was demolished in 2003 and later rebuilt.

**Urban Legends**  
After the tragic Garley Building fire, a few urban legends emerged:
1. A few days before the fire, singer Priscilla Chan went back to office on the 10th floor usually. Instead of stopping at 10/F, the elevator suddenly ascended to the 15th floor. It was pitch black outside the elevator, and some believed she had a glimpse of the ruined 15/F after the fire.
2. Months after the fire, Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station repeatedly receive emergency calls from time to time reporting a big fire in the Garley Building. The call was traced and it showed that the call was made from the burn-out 15/F in the Garley Building.
3. A nearby restaurant occationally recieved food delivery orders from a unit of the Garley Building. The food delivery guy went to the address and were told that the unit was burnt down in the fire and the entire floor was sealed.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
These urban legends reflect the collective trauma and lingering fears associated with the Garley Building fire. They serve as haunting reminders of the tragedy, symbolizing unresolved grief and the human tendency to seek meaning in the aftermath of disasters. These stories also act as a warning and highlight concerns about safety regulations and the importance of fire prevention in densely populated urban environments especially for older buildings.
