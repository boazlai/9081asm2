# Haunted Orders: Ghosts, Mahjong & Midnight Deliveries

**A 90-Minute Urban Legend Walking + MTR Tour of Yau Ma Tei & Hung Hom**  
_Designed for international HKU students who want real Hong Kong ghost stories, dark history, and a proper thrill — no tourist traps, no fake jump-scares, just pure local chills_

## 1. Title & Tour Concept

### Tour Concept (60 words)

Ghost hunger and playfulness animate our night walk: from Tin Hau Temple’s protective threshold to mahjong echoes in Man Hoo Court, delivery calls drifting through Yau Ma Tei Carpark, a vanished jumper legend beneath the station lights, and JD Mall’s lingering fire phones. We trace how everyday Hong Kong rituals let the dead keep participating within shared memory and humour.

### What Makes This Tour Unique

This is the only tour that connects the “ghost food-delivery” and “mahjong ghost” motifs across decades and districts. Instead of generic haunted-house stories, you get five sites where the dead literally try to keep living Hong Kong daily life — ordering porridge, collecting mahjong winnings, calling the police for help. The emotional arc moves from modern tragedy (Garley fire) to 1950s mystery to the heartbreaking WWII school bombing, ending with a surprisingly tender ritual that still happens every night.

## 3. Checkpoint 1 · Tin Hau Temple (Yau Ma Tei)

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Tin Hau Temple courtyard]`

**Background Fact**  
19th‑century Tin Hau Temple complex guarding seafarers and market folk; a daily threshold between sacred shelter and the city’s commerce. Opposite once stood tong lau linked to early mahjong parlours.

**Urban Legends**  
Mahjong ghosts across the street “borrow” temple protection to keep playing; late phone orders for porridge answered by a paying hand that turns into joss paper on the return walk; incense smoke said to outline headless players before dispersing.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Temple as communal firewall: legends frame play, food and worship as one ecosystem where the dead remain socially included rather than exiled.

## 4. Checkpoint 2 · Yau Ma Tei Carpark Building

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Yau Ma Tei Carpark exterior]`

**Background Fact**  
Multi‑storey carpark replacing layers of older street life; slated for redevelopment. Upper decks overlook former sites of mahjong flats and night stalls.

**Urban Legends**  
After closing, elevators allegedly stop at a “sealed” level where delivery riders hear tile shuffling; food orders accepted by a gloved hand paying with crisp notes that later fade into joss paper; phantom phone rings traced to no active line.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Vertical infrastructure becomes archive: each floor a stratum where ordinary leisure (driving, eating, gaming) blurs with remembrance of losses.

## 5. Checkpoint 3 · Man Hoo Court

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Man Hoo Court facade]`

**Background Fact**  
Modern residential block amid former tong lau cluster; inherits stories from pre‑redevelopment flats where parlours operated semi‑legally.

**Urban Legends**  
Signature “mahjong ghost suite”: disembodied hand collecting winnings; four headless players locked in endless round at 9 pm; porridge delivery incident ending with payment transforming into joss paper mid‑staircase.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Legends migrate to newer buildings, showing how community memory reattaches to fresh concrete rather than disappearing with demolition.

## 6. Checkpoint 4 · Yau Ma Tei MTR Station – Platform 1

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – Yau Ma Tei MTR platform]`

**Background Fact**  
Opened 1979; early decades without platform screen doors intensified danger imagery.

**Urban Legend**  
10 Nov 1981 alleged jump: driver, passengers see girl fall; full search reveals no body or blood. Variant: a student witnesses her own doppelgänger jump and later “dies of fright”; 2019 retelling reframes as miraculous survival between rails.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
Story mutates with each mental health spike—mechanism for converting anonymous tragedy into cautionary miracle narrative.

## 7. Checkpoint 5 · JD Mall (former Garley Building site)

`[IMAGE_PLACEHOLDER_9x16 – JD Mall / Garley Building site]`

**Background Fact**  
20 Nov 1996 Garley Building fire: sparks, chimney‑like lift shaft, 41 deaths; demolished 2003, JD Mall replaces structure.

**Urban Legends**  
Lift allegedly stopping at non‑existent 15/F; post‑fire emergency calls from cancelled floor numbers pleading for rescue; food delivery orders from sealed levels, a hand paying in joss paper.

**Modern Reinterpretation**  
“Ghost delivery” meme localizes grief as ongoing appetite—victims reframed as still sharing Hong Kong’s nocturnal routines.
