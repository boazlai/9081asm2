            Designed for international HKU students who want real Hong Kong
            ghost stories, dark history, and a proper thrill — no tourist traps,
            no fake jump-scares, just pure local chills.

            <h2>Tour Concept</h2>
            <p>
              Most Hong Kong ghost stories feel random, but in Yau Ma Tei and
              Hung Hom there is a strange pattern: the dead keep trying to join
              the living’s favourite activities — playing mahjong and ordering
              late-night food deliveries. This tour follows that eerie thread
              across five haunting sites, connecting the 1996 Garley Building
              fire, 1950s mahjong-parlour ghosts, and the 1944 Allied bombing
              that killed 200 schoolchildren.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participants will stand where delivery boys received joss paper
              instead of cash, where headless mahjong players were seen through
              windows, and where temple caretakers still call the child ghosts
              home every night. By blending archival facts, multiple versions of
              the legends, and on-site observation, the tour reveals how Hong
              Kong uses humour, food, and games to process unthinkable tragedy.
              The experience turns fear into empathy and shows how urban legends
              keep the forgotten dead “alive” in collective memory. Perfect for
              international students who want to feel the real pulse (and
              chills) of Hong Kong culture.

            <h2>What Makes This Tour Unique</h2>
            <p>
              This is the only tour that connects the “ghost food-delivery” and
              “mahjong ghost” motifs across decades and districts. Instead of
              generic haunted-house stories, you get five sites where the dead
              literally try to keep living Hong Kong daily life — ordering
              porridge, collecting mahjong winnings, calling the police for
              help. The emotional arc moves from modern tragedy (Garley fire) to
              1950s mystery to the heartbreaking WWII school bombing, ending
              with a surprisingly tender ritual that still happens every night.

            <h3>Checkpoint 1 · JD Mall (former Garley Building site)</h3>
            <p><strong>233 Nathan Road, Jordan (starting point)</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Background Fact:</strong> On 20 November 1996, welding
              sparks ignited wooden scaffolding inside the renovating Garley
              Building. The open elevator shaft acted like a chimney, sending
              fire and smoke racing upwards. 41 people died, many trapped on the
              upper floors. The building was demolished in 2003; JD Mall now
              stands in its place.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Urban Legends:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Priscilla Chan entered the lift to Polygram Records (10/F) but
                it shot straight to a pitch-black 15/F that shouldn’t exist.
                Some say she briefly time-traveled to the burned-out future.
              </li>
              <li>
                After the fire, Tsim Sha Tsui Police Station received repeated
                emergency calls from cancelled 15/F phone numbers: “There’s a
                huge fire, come save me!”
              </li>
              <li>
                Nearby restaurants kept receiving delivery orders from
                sealed-off floors. When the boy arrived, only a hand came out to
                pay… in joss paper.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern Reinterpretation:</strong> The “ghost delivery”
              motif is now everywhere on Hong Kong social media (Foodpanda,
              Deliveroo jokes). The dead are imagined as still hungry, still
              participating in 21st-century life — a very Hong Kong way of
              refusing to let victims be forgotten.

            <h3>Checkpoint 2 · Site of 452 Nathan Road</h3>
            <p><strong>Walk 9 minutes north along Nathan Road</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Background Fact:</strong> In the 1950s–70s this was a
              typical tong lau with mahjong parlour building. On the night of 4
              March 1953 thousands gathered to watch the “haunted flat”.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Urban Legends (the famous mahjong ghost cluster):</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ghost hand reached from under the table to collect winnings;
                another ghost hand shuffled tiles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Headless figures seen playing mahjong through the window (later
                versions say they were WWII air-raid victims still playing when
                the bomb hit).
              </li>
              <li>
                Every night at 9 pm a porridge shop received phone orders for
                four bowls to the 4th floor. The hand paid in real money… that
                turned into joss paper on the way back. When the furious
                delivery boy kicked the door down — four headless ghosts playing
                mahjong.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern Reinterpretation:</strong> Mahjong is social glue
              in Hong Kong. By imagining the dead still playing, the city keeps
              victims inside the community rather than isolated in death. The
              joss-paper punchline is dark humour — classic Hong Kong coping
              mechanism.

            <p><strong>3-minute walk from Checkpoint 2</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>Background Fact:</strong> Station opened 1979, no platform
              screen doors until much later.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Urban Legend:</strong> 10 Nov 1981, 1:50 pm: train driver
              and passengers saw a teenage girl jump. Emergency brake applied.
              Screams everywhere. After full search — no body, no blood. Some
              versions say a female student saw her doppelgänger jump and died
              of fright days later. 2019 update: the girl allegedly survived by
              lying between the rails, later became Christian.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern Reinterpretation:</strong> Classic “almost-died”
              survivor tale that keeps getting retold whenever MTR suicides
              spike. Shows how the city turns trauma into moral lesson or
              miracle story.

              <strong>Background Fact:</strong> 16 October 1944 — Allied forces
              bombed Whampoa Dock but hit the neighbouring school instead. The
              building collapsed, killing ≈200 students and teachers in minutes.
              Only those who hid in Kwun Yum Temple survived.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Urban Legends:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The temple remained completely undamaged — a miracle of Kwun Yum
                (Goddess of Mercy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Every night when the caretaker locks up, he calls out: “It’s
                dark! Temple closing! Children, come back!” so the young ghosts
                know to return to the temple instead of wandering.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern Reinterpretation:</strong> The tender nightly
              roll-call is one of Hong Kong’s most heartbreaking rituals. It
              transforms terror into care — the living still acting as
              parents/teachers to the dead children 81 years later.

            <p>
              <strong>Background Fact:</strong> Some of the school victims’
              remains were unidentifiable; ashes were mixed and interred in the
              temple walls.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Urban Legend:</strong> That’s why the temple walls are
              unusually thick — they contain the ashes of the bombed children.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Modern Reinterpretation:</strong> The wall literally
              carries the children, refusing to let urban redevelopment erase
              them. A quiet act of resistance and love.
